# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michael Farmer (https://michaelfarmer.tech/)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for work as a Full Stack developer.

ðŸ’¬ I have professional experience with HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, .NET Framework, Bootstrap, Angular, Node.js.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Angular 15.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on different projects.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m super interested in data analysis but find breaking into the industry in the near future difficult.

âš¡ Fun fact: I have a 726+ day Duolingo streak.
